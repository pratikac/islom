Use TCM interface board for gndstation

Design req. main hopper board
	
	XBee				- UART			2x 10 pin BERG-F (with footprint)
	Programing port		- PGDM/ PGDI	1x 10 pin FRC (compatible with other boards)
	2 motor+encoder		- QEI			2x 6 pin FRC

	Gyro				- SPI			seperate small board 4x 2mm DOUBLE BERG-F
	Accelerometer		- SPI			Joins main board in two places, SPI and POWER

	Battery check		- 1 ADC

	2 motor drivers		- 2 PWM + DIGITAL POWER + BATTERY POWER
	PTH
	LDO
	Battery conenctor
	Slide switch
	Interrupt switch
	3 LEDs
